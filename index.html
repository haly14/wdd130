            <p>Montana is a state in the northwestern United States. It is bordered by North Dakota and South Dakota to the East, Wyoming to the South, Idaho to the West, and shares its northern border with Canada. Montana is affectionately known as the "Treasure State" and "Big Sky Country". With a small population and wide open spaces, there are few places where you can't see a sky full of stars at night.</p>
